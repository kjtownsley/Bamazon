## How do I use _Bamazon_?
#### First open bamazonSchema.sql and create the database.  It contains items that have individual names, id, department, and cost and inventory.  
#### Second open up Terminal and open the application by entering "node bamazonCustomer.js".  This will begin the application.  
#### A list of the inventory will be displayed and the user is then prompted to enter the id number and quantity of the item they wish to purchase.
#### If there is enough inventory to fulfill the customer's order, the amount purchased will be deducted from the SQL database for that item, and a running total cost will be calculated.  The client is then prompted whether they wish to continue shopping.  
#### When the client declines to continue shopping, the application ends.
